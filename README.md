# Tailsitter_optimizer_Matlab

Using optimization algorithm (MATLAB language) with UAV's part database, such as motor, and propeller, in a market for automatic design depends on the user's need.
This project is aimed to create a preliminary tail-sitter design algorithm to improve designing capabilities using collected data from resources available in the market to make a database and decreasing design time by using Hooke-Jeeves pattern search optimization method. A result show an algorithm can select the right equipment for a require mission and designing time are decrease up to 60% from the whole time that used to compare every possible solution.

Tailsitter_Prop__HookJeeves_Opt.m is a main file for this project, another .m files work as function file.
